# Proofs
This is something to help me get through honors geo (such a vile class) without completely imploding. 
## Trisection (angles)
* If 2 rays divide an angle into 3 congruent angles, then they trisect an angle. 
* If 2 rays trisect an angle, then they divide the angle into three congruent angles.

## Bisection
* If a ray divides an angle into 2 congruent angles, then they bisect the angle.
* If a ray bisects an angle, then it divides the angle into 2 congruent angles.

## Trisection (lines)
* If 2 points divide a segment into three congruent segments, then they trisect the segment.
* If a segment is trisected, then it is divided into three segments.  

## Midpoint
* If a point divides a segment into 2 congruent segments, then it is the midpoint. 
* If a point is a midpoint, then it divides the segment into 2 congruent segments. 

## Perpendicular
* If segments (ray, line..) are right angles, then they are perpendicular
* If angles are perpendicular, then they are right angles

## Complementary (90 degree)
* If two angles add to 90 degrees, they are complementary.
* If two angles are complementary, they will add to 90 degrees. 

## Supplementary (180 degree)
* If two angles add to 180 degrees, then they are supplementary.
* If two angles are supplementary, then they add to 180 degrees.
